This repository contains my Neovim configuration. The current setup is written in **Lua** and uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management. The previous `init.vim` is kept in the repository as a reference backup.

See `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for a checklist describing how all features from the old
`init.vim` will be ported to Lua.
